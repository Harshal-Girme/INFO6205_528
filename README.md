Solving a Knapsack problem using a Genetic Algorithm

Project Done by: Harshal Girme (Team #528) 

The knapsack problem or rucksack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.
